# Gut_Biomass_Quantification
This repo contains analysis scripts for quantifying of gut bacterial biomass in metagenomic sequencing data by normalizing by host-associated read count. The analyses involve statistical methods, such as regressions, and data visualizations to investigate relationships between bacterial biomass, stool properties, and host metadata.
